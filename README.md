# ðŸ“œ SKSE "OBody Preset Distribution Config Assistant NG"

It is a simple but powerful SKSE DLL that processes OBody preset distribution configuration files from INI, paired with SPID to manage presets to the Master OBody_presetDistributionConfig.json automatically without direct intervention. It was created with the objective of automating the application of preset rules for the OBody mod in Skyrim Special Edition, the purpose of this is to facilitate modders in delivering an OBody for their characters, and also adding a default preset which users can easily change from their game.

---

# What does it do?

Upon data loaded, scans Data for OBody_PD_*.ini files, parses rules (key = keyselec|presets|Mode), applies to OBody_presetDistributionConfig.json preserving order.

Modes:

- " x " : Unlimited â€“ adds presets to JSON every execution (does not change INI); if presets already exist in JSON, no changes are made.
- " 1 " : Once â€“ adds presets and updates INI to |0 (no further application); that is, the change is applied only once, then the INI deactivates itself.
- " 0 " : No apply â€“ skips the rule and logs "Skipped"; the INI is deactivated and no changes are made to the JSON.
- " - " : Removes specific preset â€“ searches with "!" (e.g., "!CCPoundcakeNaked2" removes "CCPoundcakeNaked2"), updates INI to |0.
- "x- " : Removes specific preset every execution â€“ (does not change INI); if presets already Removes, no changes are made.
- " * " : Removes complete entry from the key (e.g., npc or race) â€“ (e.g., "YurianaWench.esp" and presets), updates INI to |0.
- " x* " : Removes complete entry from the key every executionâ€“ (does not change INI); if presets already Removes, no changes are made.

If JSON cannot be read (e.g., due to execution path discrepancy), process stops for stability to avoid CTD or problems.

## INI Rules Examples

```
;OBody_preset_Distribution_Config_Assistant-NG

;Example of code designs: it's very similar to SPID but shorter and simpler.

; npcFormID = xx0001|Preset,...|x , 1 , 0 , - , *             FormID
; npc = EditorID|Preset,...|x , 1 , 0 , - , *                    EditorID name like 000Rabbit_NPC or Serana
; factionFemale = Faction|Preset,...|x , 1 , 0 , - , *           Faction name like "ImperialFaction" or "KhajiitFaction"
; factionMale = Faction|Preset,...|x , 1 , 0 , - , *
; npcPluginFemale = Plugin.esp|Preset,...|x , 1 , 0 , - , *       The name of the esp, who has a defined body
; npcPluginMale = Plugin.esp|Preset,...|x , 1 , 0 , - , *
; raceFemale = Race|Preset,...|x , 1 , 0 , - , *                Work with "NordRace", "OrcRace", "ArgonianRace", "HighElfRace", "WoodElfRace", "DarkElfRace", "BretonRace", "ImperialRace", "KhajiitRace", "RedguardRace", "ElderRace"  or  Works with custom races too
; raceMale = Race|Preset,...|x , 1 , 0 , - , *
